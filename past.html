    <h1>The Past</h1>

    <p>I was born the second child into an eventual family of 6, in Orem,
      Utah on August 28th, 1982. As the oldest boy I asuumed the role of the rebel.
      <a href="art.html" class="artlink">Art</a>, music, and skateboarding took up most of my attention. I first ventured
      into the world of coding when I started collecting hard to find punk music.
      I built a basic tape trading website, met some kids, moved to Milwuakee, and
      formed some bands. 15 years later, back in Utah, a group of friends including my
      girlfriend Marisa, discovered their own interest in coding and convinced me
      to come along to a meetup at Devpoint Labs. I was surprised that I remembered
      some of the basic code and concepts and was once again excited about the
      challange of coding.
